# pseudocode

# make a loop for trying the program again option

    # ask user for their desired operation

    # check if the inputs are the given operations
        
        # see if the user inputted the correct value

        # if not, print the error phrase and will make the user type values again

        # make addition operation

        # make subtraction operation
        
        # make multiplication operation

        # make division operation

            # ask the user if they want the form, decimal or fraction

            # make division operation with decimal answer

            # make division operation with fraction answer

        # ask the user if they want to calculate again

        # if no, break the loop
    
    # make the user input again if they inputted wrong string
